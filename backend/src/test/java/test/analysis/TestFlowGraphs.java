 * Unfortunately, there's no good way that I can think of to test this phase
 * reliably.
 * <p>
 * So what we will do is simply to compile again all the TestTranslate programs into
 * IR code, then convert these into assem instructions, and then build a flow graph from
 * the assem code. The final result of this process is then dumped onto System.out.
 * <p>
 * The test provided here is therefore not much more than a test that your code produces
 * some output without crashing, not whether this output is correct in any sense.
