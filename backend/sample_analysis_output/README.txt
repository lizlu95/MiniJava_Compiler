This folder contains some sample output from running the "whileLoop" unit test for each 
analysis.

This sample output is provided so you could have a look at it to see what a good 
output looks like. It is not intended to force you make your implementation produce
output which is exactly identical.

However, you should try to ensure that your test output contains sufficient information,
in readable format that is relatively easy to inspect manually (you will not be able to
check the correctness of your algorithms except by manual inspection).
